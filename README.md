🚀 LeetCode Practice

A collection of LeetCode problems solved to strengthen **Data Structures & Algorithms** with a focus on **clean logic**, **optimal solutions**, and **interview-ready code**.


# What This Repository Contains

* Daily LeetCode problem solutions
* Python implementations following LeetCode’s standard format
* Optimized approaches with correct time and space complexity


# Important Note About LeetCode Format

LeetCode is a **judge-based platform**.

Only the function logic is written.
Input, output, and test execution are handled internally.

Standard format used:

```python
class Solution:
    def functionName(self, parameters):
        return answer
```

No `main()`, no `print()`, no input handling.

# Goal

Build strong DSA fundamentals and prepare for technical interviews through consistent practice.
