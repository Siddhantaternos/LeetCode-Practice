## 🚀 LeetCode Practice

A structured collection of **LeetCode solutions** focused on building strong **Data Structures & Algorithms** fundamentals with **clean logic**, **optimal complexity**, and **interview-ready code**.

---

## What’s Inside

* Daily LeetCode practice (topic-wise, not random)
* Python solutions using standard LeetCode format
* Emphasis on clarity, patterns, and efficiency

```python
class Solution:
    def functionName(self, parameters):
        return answer
```

> LeetCode handles input/output internally.
> Only core logic is implemented here.

## Goal

Develop sharp DSA intuition and problem-solving skills required for **technical interviews**, through consistent and disciplined practice.

## DSA / LeetCode Flow (Interview-Oriented)

```
Math & Complexity
   ↓
Arrays → Strings → Hashing
   ↓
Two Pointers → Sliding Window → Prefix Sum
   ↓
Stack → Queue → Linked List
   ↓
Sorting → Binary Search
   ↓
Trees (DFS/BFS) → Graphs
   ↓
Recursion → Backtracking → Dynamic Programming
   ↓
Greedy → Heaps → Intervals
```

## How to Use This Repo

* Solve problems **topic-wise**
* Focus on **patterns**, not problem count
* Typical target per topic:

  * Easy: 5–10
  * Medium: 10–15
  * Hard: optional (later)

## Reality Check

Skipping patterns breaks interviews.
Jumping to DP too early breaks confidence.
Ignoring trees/graphs breaks callbacks.

Consistency > volume.
Execution > ego.
