1. Two Sum
Problem:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
Each input has exactly one solution.
You cannot use the same element twice.
Return the answer in any order.
Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
Follow-up: Can you solve it in less than O(n²) time?

Idea:
Check all pairs of different indices. If their sum equals target, return their indices.
Nested loops required:
First loop: index i from 0 to n-1
Second loop: index j from i+1 to n-1
for i in 0 to n-1:       # first number
    for j in i+1 to n-1: # second number

Number of pairs:
If array has n numbers → n * (n-1) / 2 pairs
Example: [2,10,4,6] → 4 numbers → 6 pairs
Pairs: (2,10), (2,4), (2,6), (10,4), (10,6), (4,6)
Time Complexity:
Each pair is checked once → O(n²)
Brute force is inefficient for large arrays.
Code: 

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[j] == target - nums[i]:
                    return [i, j]
        # Return an empty list if no solution is found
        return []
